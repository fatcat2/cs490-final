            As cases of the coronavirus spiked, businesses around the country shut down as part of local health department orders.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The gears of the United States economy came grinding to a halt as the virus made its first run through the US in the spring of 2020 with the national unemployment rate spiking to 14.4% in April. Locally in Tippecanoe County, the unemployment rate hit 12.6% - the highest it had been in over 20 years. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With people losing their jobs left and right, many officials and legislators at the federal and state levels signed moratoriums on evictions in order to put a stop to the number of people on the streets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though the moratorium was signed on May 1 and didn't expire until three months later, a few cases were still filed before Aug. 17. The circumstances behind the evictions are unknown.
          </p>

            But as soon as the moratorium was lifted on Aug. 17, 2020, there was a spike of 108 small claims evictions filed in Tippecanoe County.

            Kylee Stinebaugh is one of the 108 tenants who had evictions filed against them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her unzipped suitcase sat on the seat of a pink bike outside the apartment's door. Her landlord, Consolidated Property Management, had filed to evict her on Aug. 17, leaving her scrambling to get her things out the door as soon as possible. With a $2,545.88 judgment issued on Sept. 1 for missed rent payments and court fees, made possible by the expiration of Indiana's eviction moratorium, Stinebaugh scrambled for government assistance to no avail.

            "I'm at this point homeless," she said, noting she would sleep on a friend's couch for the time being. Her girls are staying with their father.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since her daughters' school had closed in March, she had to quit her job and stay home in order to take care of them.

            Two weeks after the statewide eviction moratorium expired, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued its own eviction moratorium, but had some extra restrictions: the evictions had to be related to being unable to paying rent and the onus was on the residents to file the document with the court and to show the landlords.
          </p>
          <p>
            But some tenants were having trouble getting the moratorium to work for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Andre Neal, 32, was evicted for owing $3,732.91 to Consolidated Property Management and had until Sept. 15 to move out of his apartment on Teal Road. When he brought his signed CDC moratorium document to the court, he was met with disappointment.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The judge basically told me that they don't apply to me because they filed for eviction before it got implemented," he said. "And nowhere in the eviction moratorium does it say you have to be in a certain stage of eviction. It just says the eviction has to disenfranchise you."
          </p>
          <p>
            Neal had lost his job of eight years as a Steak 'n Shake employee in March when his manager stopped responding to his texts. When he tried applying for rent help at the Lafayette Urban Ministry, he found that he wasn't the only one seeking help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally, LUM's Good Samaritan Fund spend at most $10,000 to help pay rents, according to data supplied by the website. A normal June would run them $8,437.
          </p>
          <p>
            That number quintupled this year, with $38,350 in relief funds distributed to applicants.
          </p>
          <p>
            "It's just like 'no's' everywhere you turn," he said. "I've been trying to get help since the government started in July. I applied on July 23 and they filed for eviction on August 18. So between that timeline, what were you doing?"

            The trend was reflected in the average eviction grant rate, with about 58% of evictions going through. Additionally, the average rent owed by evictees between May 1 and Oct. 31 was $2,200.75. With the median rent in Tippecanoe County being $886 in 2019, the tenants on average were owing about two-and-a-half months' worth of rent.

            Out of all the plaintiffs in the evictions cases from May 1 to Nov. 11, BW Parks Property Management received the most money from lawsuits, taking in $60,796.35 with an eviction success rate of 66.67%.
          </h3>
          <p>The plaintiff that filed the most cases was not necessarily the most successful either. Property management company Titan Management filed the most cases by far, clocking in at 48, but only had a 33% success rate and made far less money from their judgements as a result.</p>
          <p>Another interesting plaintiff is Chaofeng Liu, who had an average success rate but filed the fourth-most cases, despite being a single person. </p>
